    crucial:"Aatrox has got a lot of damage once his spells hit, so try to avoid getting hit by his spells as much as possible. If you get hit in by the darker red part of his abilities, they'll crit and knock you up (and that part also does more damage)- you definitely don't want that to happen. Thats also why the use of 2nd Q and E plays a much bigger role in this matchup than in most others. Be aware of his E since he is able to use it while Q’ing, allowing him to reposition his Q. Try to be well positioned and dont dodge his spells in a straight line but rather sideways (works well vs 1st Q, against 2nd Q it‘s either sideways or straight line depending on your positioning obviously) ",
    lvl1:"** Level 1:** Care about Aatrox cheesing in bushes when you walk to lane, his Q hurts a lot. Else you just don’t wanna get caught by his spells, it doesn’t really matter if you start Q or E level 1. You can go for a short Q combo but only if you’re sure you won’t get hit by his spells in return. His first 2 levels are a bit stronger than yours due to his slightly higher range. Try focus on cs and wait for your later powerspikes.",
    lvl3:"** Level 3:** If she has shroud you cant fight back, try to bait the shroud and just wait it out afterwards. You should try to always use your shield not just as a dash because her dmg is insane so you should block as much as possible. Don't let her re-engage afterwards with E.",
    lvl6:"** Level 6:** Make sure she doesn't dodge your R2 with her R1/R2. You win an all in if you play around shroud CD. Be careful about picking the correct time to all in because she can just E away and force you to use more dashes to reach her. Do not try to reach her if she does this instead of commiting to the fight because you will definitely lose afterwards unless you are ahead.",
    tldr: "His laning is very strong but very punishable. If you aren't confident in yourself, it’s better to just farm up and wait for your jungler to gank. Try to dodge as many spells as you can and safely punish him for using spells. Don’t get bullied out of lane and work as a teamplayer by roaming and helping out others.

Her W only provides healing and max dmg when she hits you with the outer part, so you should try either dashing out of it or going for a trade when you expected her to use W. Her dash is also very predictable and even cancellable, make use of that and dodge it or cancel it with a stun to maybe even get a kill.",
    lvl1:"** Level 1:** Care about trades cause Camille’s Q enables her to weave auto attacks very well, so her dps is very high at early stages resulting in you most likely losing the trade. Rather farm up safely and wait for your other spells.",

You should always try to avoid getting hit by Camilles W to deny as much sustain as possible. Generally you’re supposed to win post-6 because of your kit alone. If you traded correctly (which I won’t explain here – it’s mostly usual trading patterns -) you should be able to kill Camille one or two times in lane. Keep your E up to dodge her abilities after you went for a trade.",
    lvl6:"** Level 6:** Basically Level 3 but with the exceptions that you should not waste all of your abilities at once since she can lock you down to a small area with her R. This is also why you should be aware about ganks. Camille has good setup. Anyway with your R you can easily go for a very quick kill on Camille, especially when she has once used her E. She has only got one escape, make use of that. Your burst early on is very high",
    tldr:"Let the wave slowpush to you, there's a low chance that you're going to win lane againt a decent Camille due to her overpowered kit against Riven, wait for jungler ganks, get the first tower, and start roaming, since she can still 1v1 you while being 0/3. Try avoiding trades, since she wins nearly every trade, unless she wastes her E/Q. You're allowed to start fighting her when they go on CD, since their CD is long, you still shouldn’t overextend."

  {
    name:"Cassiopeia",
    image:CassiopeiaSquare,
  
    crucial: "  Her primary source of damage isn’t her E; it’s her poison from Q and W. Her E has a 1.1 AP ratio and weak base damage – it only deals substantial damage if she’s able to use it on a poisoned target, where not only does she get bonus damage, she gets a reset on the CD and thus is able to get higher DPS. Her W has a minimum cast range – she cannot cast it defensively on herself, only to stop at the start of your engage and when she wants to zone you out/engage herself. Her Q gives her bonus movement speed, so she’s virtually impossible to catch if she lands it. Her ultimate still deals damage if you turn away from it, so dodging it doesn’t win you the fight. ",
    lvl1:"** Level 1:**  You’d be surprised that she can’t actually deal as damage as you’d expect. If she starts Q she won’t be able to farm or trade with you, so she will almost always take E. If she chooses to use it on you, she won’t get any refund, and if she auto attacks you she draws minion aggro. You can trade her auto attacks with your minions’ and still go for last hits on farm. Though you may already know this (and it works for all ranged champions), having her auto attack you is an easy way to get the lane push up to you – if she does auto attack you, it draws you melee minions to attack her. This cause the lane to push in faster, which will mean you lose less farm to her freeze if she attempts it and you can’t respond. Be cautious that she doesn’t just auto attack you to death or destroy your HP bar to a point where you have to back.",
    lvl3:"** Level 3:**  At this point everything rests on her Q. Without it, she can’t out trade you unless you walk face first into her and get caught in her W. If she does miss Q, just wait until she mispositions where you can go for: Q + W (and then fast combo) + AA + Q + COG + AA + Q + AA + E (COG means click on ground. Use E to back off after fighting) or double cast combo: E + AA + W + Q. Remember she can’t self-cast W, so she can’t do anything if you engage when she mispositions. If she lands her Q, use your E and Q to back off. You likely won’t be able to push this lane in, but even still make sure you don’t because it gives her enough space to run you down and kill you.",
    lvl6:"** Level 6:**  This is where your fancy foot work comes in. Keep going for trades like at level 3 when she mispositions. Take her to around 40-60% HP, then look for an all-in. You can also use your flash in two different ways – either to get in range for your combo or to dodge the Cassiopeia’s ult. This is only dependent however on whether or not you think you can dodge it by turning or not, thus with practice the first option is always best. Your engage will somewhat resemble the Shy combo: E + R + F + W + Q (then fast combo) + AA + Q + COG + AA + Q. If she doesn’t have flash and you can dodge the ult there is very little way of her reacting to this. If she does have flash and you don’t dodge the ult then I just got you killed. On a more serious note, even if she does land R and has flash, if you were able to dodge her Q she will severely lack damage until she gets into W range. Her ultimate lasts 2 seconds so this is entirely possible but you can still win the fight if she can’t land Q (depends on circumstances of course however). If you turn backwards right after flashing, you’ll have the highest chance of dodging her ult because by instinct this is when she’s most likely to ult. Alternatively you could just be a really safe player and play the rest of this lane passively and wait until you can group with your team or roam, both of which are perfectly fine, it’s just that neither of those will net you montage clips. What is league anyway if you don’t have montage clips, especially on Riven? Baseline – don’t be too scared (unless you want to win the game).",
    tldr:"First of all don’t be a really safe player (unless you want to win the game). Her damage isn’t really all that scary if she can’t land Q (her W is much harder to land and poke you with, and if she does use you’re free to engage or call for the jungler’s help). Keep up the fancy footwork and she loses a lot of repositioning time with her ult, which you can use to stick on to her and prevent her from kiting. With all that said, this is a hard match up, so if you do start to lose stop trying to win the lane and focus on the rest of the game instead, because that’s where you’re most likely to win."

    name:"Cho'Gath",

    image:ChoGathSquare,
    crucial: "Feels nice to E or Q behind him to dodge his silence but you still get silenced, doesn't it just feel good when that happens? Also a good Cho is NEVER out of mana, his passive refunds him HP+MP for every minion kill so his mana pool should stay relatively high or not fall under 20-30% unless he’s boosted and can't manage his mana.",
    lvl1:"** Level 1:**  Cho starts E usually. If he starts Q - Go on him the moment you see that. He can't touch you even if he tries to Q you just dodge it with Q. If he starts W - it's a bit more tricky here since he stops you from Q-ing for 1.5 seconds but you can hold your Q longer than that so in general it's the same AA>Q>AA>Q>AA>Q>AA just with a delay meaning you will probably AA>Q>AA>AA>AA>Q>AA>Q>AA. If he starts E - he can effectively trade with you and potentially out-trade you because of the slow and %hp damage. When you see him using that E make a run for it till it expires.",
    lvl3:"** Level 3:**  He can silence you so you can't Q/E out of his Q. And your Q is pretty much done for if its perfectly centered Q. Thankfully that will rarely happen, regretfully he can E to slow you and then its a 100% knockup that will lead to another slow after 1.5seconds. You should always try to predict his Q placement and you should never be in range for a silence+E slow+Q. Cho players often use E to push lane so that can be your window of opportunity or you can try to bait it out. Its easy to see his W animation if he tries to silence you so if you react fast enough ur safe anyway. Dont stand behind minions so he cant harass you with E. If he doesnt have E you can easily engage on him and freely win the trade. Just make sure you dodge the knock up.",
    lvl6:"** Level 6:**  He will most likely waste his R on minions for stacks so you repeat level 3 BUT you have your ult which gives you an advantage. His ult gives him 80 bonus HP per stack so that's basically 1 additional auto which isn't much tbh. He can only gain up to 6 stacks (6x80 = 480 HP) from non-epic monsters or minions meaning he will have to eat champions or jungle camps to grow further",

    lvl1: "** Level 1:** If you get within auto range without having to Q to dodge his Q then you've pretty much won the trade already. If he starts W you cant fight him. If its Q though and you manage to dodge his Q just do a quick Q AA combo on him and you should safely win that trade. Make sure not to get 5 stacks of his passive even if it means Q3 to get away. The bleed will destroy you. If you have to Q to dodge his Q but still want to fight him you'll have to Q3 out. You wont flatout win the trade if you Q1 to dodge his Q. It wont even be close. If you have comet tho your comet most likely wont land so dont fight him pre 3 with comet. If you have aftershock you're procing it too late so dont fight pre 3 with aftershock. You win this with conq only pretty much. IF HE HAS GHOST DONT MAKE THE TRADE TOO LONG BECAUSE IF HE GETS 3 OR 4 STACKS ON YOU HE MIGHT DECIDE TO JUST GHOST AND AUTO YOU DOWN.

Best trade scenario you E auto WQ auto and either QQ out or go super balls deep if you have good cdr ( which i know you dont cuz we cant start with 15% cdr anymore ) Q auto then EQ away Comet is simpler than conq. With conq you want to bait out E and then do an extended fight while STILL saving a AT LEAST 1 Q to get out. IF HE HAS GHOST THERES QUITE THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE WILL GHOST AT THE END OF YOUR TRADE TO GET CLOSE TO MAKE SURE HE CANT MISS E EVEN IF HE WANTS TO.

Pros and Cons => Safer with aftershock, however slower thus leading to a potential 5stacks passive and him healing with Q and just killing you if you cant dodge Q. Comet is the gucci gang of short trades. You might want to trade well at least 2-3 times before all inting him. Conqueror is a rune that makes it easy to just all in him without having to excessively trade. GHOST WILL BE IRRELEVANT HERE IF YOU DO A PROPER ALL IN, ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT AND YOU CANT DISENGAGE. YOU HAVE TO FULLY COMMIT HERE",

E out If he has used his Q and tries to go for a minion you can do an extended trade like (E>AA>Q>W>AA>Q) and Q out. The reason you trade with him while his Q is down is not only because of less damage but also he won’t be able to proc his passive fast enough to disengage freely. If you made him low with that first trade and he didn’t back yet you have kill pressure because if he even comes near with ~60% HP you will be able to kill him. Also in trades if he uses his W just back off when you see it landing and wait for the next rotation.",

You can force small trades when he goes for minions but you should definitely make sure you either dodge his Q when it comes back or make him use it for farm. That way you punish downtimes and all thats left is to chip away at him till you can oneshot him.",

    image: FioraSquare,
    crucial:"Fiora’s parry and vitals are probably the most important thing about this match up. Do not make any predictable CC attempts, because the lane is often decided by whether Fiora lands the parry or not. If a Fiora vital appears in an unfavourable spot, e.g. if there’s one in front of you, step into the bush and have it reposition so it’s appears behind you instead. You can also hug walls that are on the side of the vital to stop Fiora reaching it. Her E works in two parts – the FIRST attack SLOWS, the SECOND attack CRITS. You always want to shield the second part of her E, and not the first. A poor Fiora will maintain the same pattern of parrying – she will always try to parry a specific part of your combo. A good Fiora will change her parry style to throw you off – she will not expect you to stun in the same part of your combo twice. Always assume she’s the good Fiora, unless you have reason to believe otherwise. An example would be to not: E + AA + W + Q twice, instead look for perhaps E + Q + AA + W the second time. Losing animation cancels is fine if it stops you getting parried.",
    lvl1: "** Level 1:**  Fiora is able to outtrade you here. She has higher DPS because of her vitals, and she can continue to poke with her Q after you blow your combo. Only look for trades if she misses Q and the cooldown doesn’t refresh (there’s a visible indicator to show when she has hit a target with Q).",
    lvl3: "** Level 3:**  Now you can start trading. If she took E level 2, you can start trading level 2 and take W second – since she can’t parry it you’ll get higher DPS. As already mentioned do not go for any predictable CC attempts. As a general note don’t layer CC straight after your E, because this is gives the Fiora player time to react. Generally look for: E + AA + Q + COG + AA + Q (COG means click on ground, if you don’t understand look up the fast combo) then hold off on 3rd Q. If she parries then use it, otherwise just use it to back off. As for using your W, don’t always use it in the same place. Layering it in can be very difficult, because if you use it at the wrong time, she wins the fight and may even kill you. Use your W whenever you know her W is on cooldown, or if you think you can sneak it into part of the combo (e.g. just after first Q). As a general rule, Fiora has 15 seconds on her W cooldown – your abilities come up faster. Keep this in mind, and when you know her W is down, you can go for an easy double cast combo: E + AA + W + Q (then fast combo) + AA + Q + COG + AA + Q.",
    lvl6: "** Level 6:**Both of you are about equal in duelling power. However, if she’s able to get off all 4 vitals, you have a very slim chance of winning, so prevent her from doing so using the advice from part 2. Otherwise, look for trades as you would at level 3, and go for all-in’s when her W is down e.g. E + R + AA + W + Q (then fast combo) + AA + Q + COG + AA + Q + Windslash (R). If she still has her W up, you can bait by starting off the combo with E + R + AA, then holding onto W. If you successfully baited out the W, then continue with the combo as standard and you win. Normally I would refrain from ever going in on a Fiora if she had W with my ult, but if she’s in kill range and you know you won’t die, then go for it.",
    tldr: "Watch out for Fiora parry. Play unpredictably so that she can’t land it reliably, and change your stun patterns to do so. Counter her vitals by breaking vision to reposition them, and line up against walls. Shield the second part of her E, not the first. Rush BC and then DD."

Your trade should look something like this (he will likely waste his Q on ranged minons, and it has a 10 sec CD giving you an opening): use trading stance on a melee minion and trade E + AA + Q + W + AA + Q. You'll have higher DPS, but ensure his Q is down. If he uses his W at the beginning of your trade, don't take the fight and wait it out. You'll then have a 13 second window (if you don't use your Q) to go for a trade once it’s down. When he goes in for an E, wait out the channel time and use your E to dodge once he starts moving. He loses a lot of DPS and CC from this, so you can easily go for a short fast combo trade. After his E, he won't be in a favourable position for himself, but will be for you to look for a play. If he's pushed up far enough into the lane, you can likely push for a kill, or bring him low enough to go for an all-in shortly after. As with all lanes during level 3-5 is when you have minion advantage and he's pushed up into the lane.

The only mechanic that isn't well advertised in Gnar's kit is his E->R animation cancel. Basically, if Gnar is gaining enough rage so that he can jump (note, he needs a unit to do his double jump) without triggering his mega form but will have full rage somewhere in his jumping animation, Gnar can R into mega form WHILE completing the full jump. This will cancel most, if not all of the cast time of his R, and it catches tons of people off guard. Look up a video to see in action.",

Riven's new QE cancel helps a lot in meeting our win condition for the lane, as it is very difficult to react to and allows us to close the gap faster than before. It is possible to interrupt Gnar's jump with Q3; however, the Gnar is probably incompetent/tilted if he lets this happen, or if you flash Q3 to force it to happen.",

If Gnar is over 50% rage or currently in mega, you can still try to engage on him, just know that there is significantly more risk of him turning the fight around, especially if he dodges your R2. If he is close to or in mega, don't stand near walls or prepare to flash out of his R. Q-dancing does help in giving mega Gnar a hard time landing W or Q, but traditional Q-dancing (moving directly through the enemy front to back) is kind of hard with mega Gnar since his model size is massive.-----Just try not to be stationary with your Q's if he has Q/W up. Other than this, just watch out for the E->R animation cancel if he is nearing mega form. If the Gnar seems competent in the lane phase, assume that they are aware of this mechanic. Otherwise, you can usually ignore the possibility. Note that the best/safest time to engage on Gnar is when he transforms back into mini.",

    lvl6: "** Level 6:** you should at least chunk a bit of his HP in order to get a strong lvl 6 fight with your ult, and save either your third Q/W/gapcloser for after his stun to deal as much damage as possible afterwards.",
    tldr: " playing against Teemo is generally in his favour (if he's decent, and knows the matchup), so I'd just recommend farming under tower, taking short trades, and wait till you can all-in him when his Q is on CD. You can bait his Q by going in with your E-Q (or E-R-Q), but you should keep your CC-spells (W-3rd Q) for when he Q’s, so you can drop the full damage on him after his Q."

Disengage when you see this happening unless he is low enough for you to kill him fast. After all he only heals and deals 10% of the damage instantly, the other 10% is applied over the next 4 seconds. A standard rotation is fine but look for blocking all his Qs with E.",

    tldr: "Your mastery of choice should be Phase Rush. Don't fight pre 3, fight him in short trades (e.g. AA-Q-AA-W and E out). Try to blow his summs early or get EXP advantage to cheese him level 6 if that doesn't work try to trade your ult for his. Rush black cleaver for cooldown reduction and bonus movement speed, you want to kite Tryndamere while he is in his ultimate. If you are snowballing early go for Ghostblade instead. Purchase QSS or Merc Treads when you are facing a lot of point and click CC."

You need to bait out his shield and punish him when it's down but its the same CD as your Q so without any CDR you have no windows of opportunity. Sit Back and wait later levels ( and buys. )",
    lvl6: "** Level 6:**  Recall. Buy CDR. Riven's Q is 13 secs rank 1 to 5 but urgot's W falls down 1s with each level. If he maxes that AND buys CDR congratulations it doesn't matter what you do it's a farm lane. If you can set up a big minion wave you can definitely kill him. He can reactivate R when you are below 25% hp and when he ults you at lets say 35% hp he hits you 2-3 times and his ult AUTOMATICALLY reactivates. He doesn’t even have to press it on his own. You can certainly kill him without a big minion wave as well but its important to Q dance when you are low on hp so you can dodge his R and you'd need to dodge the Q as well. Quick heads up this is a lot riskier and you must be 100% certain exactly how much damage you have and you better be s3 boxbox or you're losing that.",

    lvl1: "** Level 1:**  Be aggressive, you can start at the bush which is closest to the enemy’s tower and get behind him and his minions so you can get an easy Auto + Q + Auto + Q + Auto + Q + Auto combo. Keep autoing him until you get close to turret range, if he’s under his turret back off. You should have chunked a lot of his health by now.

    crucial:"Yasuo’s shield stays active for 1 second. This means that if you proc it, you still have to give it a second before it goes away. Yasuo’s Q’s cast time scales with his attack speed – remember that as the lane goes on, his Q will become harder to dodge. Yasuo’s ultimate gives him back his shield, AND gives him bonus armor penetration, so the fight will become increasingly difficult as it goes on. A good Yasuo will player will use their E + Q combo to knock you up, rather than aiming it as a skill shot so they can ensure the knock up. Rather than attempting to dodge his Q, it’s better to remain out of range (or ensure that you have your movement spells to back off when he approaches by using his E on the minions to try to engage on you).",
    lvl1: "** Level 1:**  Yasuo can out trade you, provided he plays it correctly. If he misses a Q, use the opportunity to get a short fast combo off: AA + Q + COG (COG means click on ground) REPEAT. Otherwise, his Q has a much shorter cooldown than your Q, and he can spam it for poke when yours is down whilst getting out similar DPS in trades.",
    lvl3: "** Level 3:**  Trading with Yasuo should become a steam roll. If he tries to engage, use your W to stun him, as you can cancel his E with any form of CC. While he spends time repositioning with his E or tries to disengage, you can keep trading with him the fast combo. If he mispositions by coming too close, look for Q + W + (then fast combo) + AA + Q + COG REPEAT. You can also go for a double cast combo for a short trade with high DPS: E + AA + W + Q. You can either follow up with the rest of the fast combo: AA + Q + REPEAT, or back off with the remaining Qs, or even fast combo with 2nd Q and use the 3rd to get out.",
    lvl6: "** Level 6:**  You can still out trade him like at level 3. However, if he lands his knock up, things get very difficult. You have to be cautious about his knock up, but if he’s low enough and you know you can kill him before he runs to tower, go for the all-in. It will like look something like: E + R (then fast combo) + AA + Q + COG REPEAT. You want to save your W just before you windslash, so he can’t windwall it. If you don’t have enough range with just E, then you can use the first Q for movement, but ensure that you have enough Qs to actually deal enough damage. You want to go for kills just after he’s used his knock up, because that’s the point at which it takes the longest for him to get it back up. If he tries to engage with his E + Q and knock you up (he likely won’t throw his whirlwind out as a skill shot as I mentioned in part 2, and if he does just E to dodge it), then you can attempt: E + W + Q. This causes the stun to go off at the position you were at before the E, but your E still carries you forward, thus theoretically you can stun him and dodge the knock up. You need to get perfect timing down for this to work, because if you fail and you get knocked up, you’ve lost 3 of your spells, so you’ve basically lost the fight. Try practicing this against Yasuo’s in normal games until your confident enough to do it reliably.",
    tldr: "Yasuo’s knock up is the most important part of any fight you take with him – treat as you would a Fiora parry; if you dodge, you’re likely to win, if he lands it, he’s likely to win. Go for trades when you can level 3 as long as you don’t overextend, and go for all-ins at level 6 just after he Q’s if you can. Stun before you windslash, so he can't windwall it."

Luckily for you, there are 4 movement spells to choose from – make sure you have these up to dodge the E. Yorick can pass through his own wall by issuing a move command, but you can’t. His ult does tick damage, not consistent drain. Thus you can play around each tick of damage and shield accordingly.",

Keep this up as long as you know either his Q is on CD, or he’s just used it on a minion (and it’s therefore on CD).",

    lvl6: "** Level 6:**  Typical ult engage combo: E + R + W + Q (then fast combo). If he uses E and lands it once you go in, his ult damage will start to hurt, so make sure it’s on cooldown before engaging. Do not try to kill his ult, just focus on him.",
    tldr: "This guy’s E is everything. Dodge it and you’ll have no problems. His wall is easily avoidable and you can wallhop it with Q3. His ult becomes more problematic as the fight goes on, so end the all-in at 6 as fast possible."

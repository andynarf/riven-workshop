    crucial:"Aatrox has got a lot of damage once his spells hit, so try to avoid getting hit by his spells as much as possible. If you get hit in by the darker red part of his abilities, they'll crit and knock you up (and that part also does more damage)- you definitely don't want that to happen. Thats also why the use of 2nd Q and E plays a much bigger role in this matchup than in most others. Be aware of his E since he is able to use it while Q’ing, allowing him to reposition his Q. Try to be well positioned and dont dodge his spells in a straight line but rather sideways (works well vs 1st Q, against 2nd Q it‘s either sideways or straight line depending on your positioning obviously) ",
    lvl1:"** Level 1:** Care about Aatrox cheesing in bushes when you walk to lane, his Q hurts a lot. Else you just don’t wanna get caught by his spells, it doesn’t really matter if you start Q or E level 1. You can go for a short Q combo but only if you’re sure you won’t get hit by his spells in return. His first 2 levels are a bit stronger than yours due to his slightly higher range. Try focus on cs and wait for your later powerspikes.",
    lvl3:"** Level 3:** If she has shroud you cant fight back, try to bait the shroud and just wait it out afterwards. You should try to always use your shield not just as a dash because her dmg is insane so you should block as much as possible. Don't let her re-engage afterwards with E.",
    lvl6:"** Level 6:** Make sure she doesn't dodge your R2 with her R1/R2. You win an all in if you play around shroud CD. Be careful about picking the correct time to all in because she can just E away and force you to use more dashes to reach her. Do not try to reach her if she does this instead of commiting to the fight because you will definitely lose afterwards unless you are ahead.",

Her W only provides healing and max dmg when she hits you with the outer part, so you should try either dashing out of it or going for a trade when you expected her to use W. Her dash is also very predictable and even cancellable, make use of that and dodge it or cancel it with a stun to maybe even get a kill.",
    lvl1:"** Level 1:** Care about trades cause Camille’s Q enables her to weave auto attacks very well, so her dps is very high at early stages resulting in you most likely losing the trade. Rather farm up safely and wait for your other spells.",

You should always try to avoid getting hit by Camilles W to deny as much sustain as possible. Generally you’re supposed to win post-6 because of your kit alone. If you traded correctly (which I won’t explain here – it’s mostly usual trading patterns -) you should be able to kill Camille one or two times in lane. Keep your E up to dodge her abilities after you went for a trade.",
    lvl6:"** Level 6:** Basically Level 3 but with the exceptions that you should not waste all of your abilities at once since she can lock you down to a small area with her R. This is also why you should be aware about ganks. Camille has good setup. Anyway with your R you can easily go for a very quick kill on Camille, especially when she has once used her E. She has only got one escape, make use of that. Your burst early on is very high",
    tldr:"Let the wave slowpush to you, there's a low chance that you're going to win lane againt a decent Camille due to her overpowered kit against Riven, wait for jungler ganks, get the first tower, and start roaming, since she can still 1v1 you while being 0/3. Try avoiding trades, since she wins nearly every trade, unless she wastes her E/Q. You're allowed to start fighting her when they go on CD, since their CD is long, you still shouldn’t overextend."

  {
    name:"Cassiopeia",
    image:CassiopeiaSquare,
  
    crucial: "  Her primary source of damage isn’t her E; it’s her poison from Q and W. Her E has a 1.1 AP ratio and weak base damage – it only deals substantial damage if she’s able to use it on a poisoned target, where not only does she get bonus damage, she gets a reset on the CD and thus is able to get higher DPS. Her W has a minimum cast range – she cannot cast it defensively on herself, only to stop at the start of your engage and when she wants to zone you out/engage herself. Her Q gives her bonus movement speed, so she’s virtually impossible to catch if she lands it. Her ultimate still deals damage if you turn away from it, so dodging it doesn’t win you the fight. ",
    lvl1:"** Level 1:**  You’d be surprised that she can’t actually deal as damage as you’d expect. If she starts Q she won’t be able to farm or trade with you, so she will almost always take E. If she chooses to use it on you, she won’t get any refund, and if she auto attacks you she draws minion aggro. You can trade her auto attacks with your minions’ and still go for last hits on farm. Though you may already know this (and it works for all ranged champions), having her auto attack you is an easy way to get the lane push up to you – if she does auto attack you, it draws you melee minions to attack her. This cause the lane to push in faster, which will mean you lose less farm to her freeze if she attempts it and you can’t respond. Be cautious that she doesn’t just auto attack you to death or destroy your HP bar to a point where you have to back.",
    lvl3:"** Level 3:**  At this point everything rests on her Q. Without it, she can’t out trade you unless you walk face first into her and get caught in her W. If she does miss Q, just wait until she mispositions where you can go for: Q + W (and then fast combo) + AA + Q + COG + AA + Q + AA + E (COG means click on ground. Use E to back off after fighting) or double cast combo: E + AA + W + Q. Remember she can’t self-cast W, so she can’t do anything if you engage when she mispositions. If she lands her Q, use your E and Q to back off. You likely won’t be able to push this lane in, but even still make sure you don’t because it gives her enough space to run you down and kill you.",
    lvl6:"** Level 6:**  This is where your fancy foot work comes in. Keep going for trades like at level 3 when she mispositions. Take her to around 40-60% HP, then look for an all-in. You can also use your flash in two different ways – either to get in range for your combo or to dodge the Cassiopeia’s ult. This is only dependent however on whether or not you think you can dodge it by turning or not, thus with practice the first option is always best. Your engage will somewhat resemble the Shy combo: E + R + F + W + Q (then fast combo) + AA + Q + COG + AA + Q. If she doesn’t have flash and you can dodge the ult there is very little way of her reacting to this. If she does have flash and you don’t dodge the ult then I just got you killed. On a more serious note, even if she does land R and has flash, if you were able to dodge her Q she will severely lack damage until she gets into W range. Her ultimate lasts 2 seconds so this is entirely possible but you can still win the fight if she can’t land Q (depends on circumstances of course however). If you turn backwards right after flashing, you’ll have the highest chance of dodging her ult because by instinct this is when she’s most likely to ult. Alternatively you could just be a really safe player and play the rest of this lane passively and wait until you can group with your team or roam, both of which are perfectly fine, it’s just that neither of those will net you montage clips. What is league anyway if you don’t have montage clips, especially on Riven? Baseline – don’t be too scared (unless you want to win the game).",
    tldr:"First of all don’t be a really safe player (unless you want to win the game). Her damage isn’t really all that scary if she can’t land Q (her W is much harder to land and poke you with, and if she does use you’re free to engage or call for the jungler’s help). Keep up the fancy footwork and she loses a lot of repositioning time with her ult, which you can use to stick on to her and prevent her from kiting. With all that said, this is a hard match up, so if you do start to lose stop trying to win the lane and focus on the rest of the game instead, because that’s where you’re most likely to win."

    image:ChoGathSquare,
    crucial: "Feels nice to E or Q behind him to dodge his silence but you still get silenced, doesn't it just feel good when that happens? Also a good Cho is NEVER out of mana, his passive refunds him HP+MP for every minion kill so his mana pool should stay relatively high or not fall under 20-30% unless he’s boosted and can't manage his mana.",
    lvl1:"** Level 1:**  Cho starts E usually. If he starts Q - Go on him the moment you see that. He can't touch you even if he tries to Q you just dodge it with Q. If he starts W - it's a bit more tricky here since he stops you from Q-ing for 1.5 seconds but you can hold your Q longer than that so in general it's the same AA>Q>AA>Q>AA>Q>AA just with a delay meaning you will probably AA>Q>AA>AA>AA>Q>AA>Q>AA. If he starts E - he can effectively trade with you and potentially out-trade you because of the slow and %hp damage. When you see him using that E make a run for it till it expires.",
    lvl3:"** Level 3:**  He can silence you so you can't Q/E out of his Q. And your Q is pretty much done for if its perfectly centered Q. Thankfully that will rarely happen, regretfully he can E to slow you and then its a 100% knockup that will lead to another slow after 1.5seconds. You should always try to predict his Q placement and you should never be in range for a silence+E slow+Q. Cho players often use E to push lane so that can be your window of opportunity or you can try to bait it out. Its easy to see his W animation if he tries to silence you so if you react fast enough ur safe anyway. Dont stand behind minions so he cant harass you with E. If he doesnt have E you can easily engage on him and freely win the trade. Just make sure you dodge the knock up.",
    lvl6:"** Level 6:**  He will most likely waste his R on minions for stacks so you repeat level 3 BUT you have your ult which gives you an advantage. His ult gives him 80 bonus HP per stack so that's basically 1 additional auto which isn't much tbh. He can only gain up to 6 stacks (6x80 = 480 HP) from non-epic monsters or minions meaning he will have to eat champions or jungle camps to grow further",

    lvl1: "** Level 1:** If you get within auto range without having to Q to dodge his Q then you've pretty much won the trade already. If he starts W you cant fight him. If its Q though and you manage to dodge his Q just do a quick Q AA combo on him and you should safely win that trade. Make sure not to get 5 stacks of his passive even if it means Q3 to get away. The bleed will destroy you. If you have to Q to dodge his Q but still want to fight him you'll have to Q3 out. You wont flatout win the trade if you Q1 to dodge his Q. It wont even be close. If you have comet tho your comet most likely wont land so dont fight him pre 3 with comet. If you have aftershock you're procing it too late so dont fight pre 3 with aftershock. You win this with conq only pretty much. IF HE HAS GHOST DONT MAKE THE TRADE TOO LONG BECAUSE IF HE GETS 3 OR 4 STACKS ON YOU HE MIGHT DECIDE TO JUST GHOST AND AUTO YOU DOWN.

Best trade scenario you E auto WQ auto and either QQ out or go super balls deep if you have good cdr ( which i know you dont cuz we cant start with 15% cdr anymore ) Q auto then EQ away Comet is simpler than conq. With conq you want to bait out E and then do an extended fight while STILL saving a AT LEAST 1 Q to get out.

Pros and Cons => Safer with aftershock, however slower thus leading to a potential 5stacks passive and him healing with Q and just killing you if you cant dodge Q. Comet is the gucci gang of short trades. You might want to trade well at least 2-3 times before all inting him. Conqueror is a rune that makes it easy to just all in him without having to excessively trade. GHOST WILL BE IRRELEVANT HERE IF YOU DO A PROPER ALL IN, ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT AND YOU CANT DISENGAGE.

E out If he has used his Q and tries to go for a minion you can do an extended trade like (E>AA>Q>W>AA>Q) and Q out. The reason you trade with him while his Q is down is not only because of less damage but also he won’t be able to proc his passive fast enough to disengage freely. If you made him low with that first trade and he didn’t back yet you have kill pressure because if he even comes near with ~60% HP you will be able to kill him. Also in trades if he uses his W just back off when you see it landing and wait for the next rotation.",

You can force small trades when he goes for minions but you should definitely make sure you either dodge his Q when it comes back or make him use it for farm. That way you punish downtimes and all thats left is to chip away at him till you can oneshot him.",

    image: FioraSquare,
    crucial:"Fiora’s parry and vitals are probably the most important thing about this match up. Do not make any predictable CC attempts, because the lane is often decided by whether Fiora lands the parry or not. If a Fiora vital appears in an unfavourable spot, e.g. if there’s one in front of you, step into the bush and have it reposition so it’s appears behind you instead. You can also hug walls that are on the side of the vital to stop Fiora reaching it. Her E works in two parts – the FIRST attack SLOWS, the SECOND attack CRITS. You always want to shield the second part of her E, and not the first. A poor Fiora will maintain the same pattern of parrying – she will always try to parry a specific part of your combo. A good Fiora will change her parry style to throw you off – she will not expect you to stun in the same part of your combo twice. Always assume she’s the good Fiora, unless you have reason to believe otherwise. An example would be to not: E + AA + W + Q twice, instead look for perhaps E + Q + AA + W the second time. Losing animation cancels is fine if it stops you getting parried.",
    lvl1: "** Level 1:**  Fiora is able to outtrade you here. She has higher DPS because of her vitals, and she can continue to poke with her Q after you blow your combo. Only look for trades if she misses Q and the cooldown doesn’t refresh (there’s a visible indicator to show when she has hit a target with Q).",
    lvl3: "** Level 3:**  Now you can start trading. If she took E level 2, you can start trading level 2 and take W second – since she can’t parry it you’ll get higher DPS. As already mentioned do not go for any predictable CC attempts. As a general note don’t layer CC straight after your E, because this is gives the Fiora player time to react. Generally look for: E + AA + Q + COG + AA + Q (COG means click on ground, if you don’t understand look up the fast combo) then hold off on 3rd Q. If she parries then use it, otherwise just use it to back off. As for using your W, don’t always use it in the same place. Layering it in can be very difficult, because if you use it at the wrong time, she wins the fight and may even kill you. Use your W whenever you know her W is on cooldown, or if you think you can sneak it into part of the combo (e.g. just after first Q). As a general rule, Fiora has 15 seconds on her W cooldown – your abilities come up faster. Keep this in mind, and when you know her W is down, you can go for an easy double cast combo: E + AA + W + Q (then fast combo) + AA + Q + COG + AA + Q.",
    lvl6: "** Level 6:**Both of you are about equal in duelling power. However, if she’s able to get off all 4 vitals, you have a very slim chance of winning, so prevent her from doing so using the advice from part 2. Otherwise, look for trades as you would at level 3, and go for all-in’s when her W is down e.g. E + R + AA + W + Q (then fast combo) + AA + Q + COG + AA + Q + Windslash (R). If she still has her W up, you can bait by starting off the combo with E + R + AA, then holding onto W. If you successfully baited out the W, then continue with the combo as standard and you win. Normally I would refrain from ever going in on a Fiora if she had W with my ult, but if she’s in kill range and you know you won’t die, then go for it.",
    tldr: "Watch out for Fiora parry. Play unpredictably so that she can’t land it reliably, and change your stun patterns to do so. Counter her vitals by breaking vision to reposition them, and line up against walls. Shield the second part of her E, not the first. Rush BC and then DD."

Your trade should look something like this (he will likely waste his Q on ranged minons, and it has a 10 sec CD giving you an opening): use trading stance on a melee minion and trade E + AA + Q + W + AA + Q. You'll have higher DPS, but ensure his Q is down. If he uses his W at the beginning of your trade, don't take the fight and wait it out. You'll then have a 13 second window (if you don't use your Q) to go for a trade once it’s down. When he goes in for an E, wait out the channel time and use your E to dodge once he starts moving. He loses a lot of DPS and CC from this, so you can easily go for a short fast combo trade. After his E, he won't be in a favourable position for himself, but will be for you to look for a play. If he's pushed up far enough into the lane, you can likely push for a kill, or bring him low enough to go for an all-in shortly after. As with all lanes during level 3-5 is when you have minion advantage and he's pushed up into the lane. His E plunges him straight into minion aggro, so you'll have the advantage from minion damage - don't be scared to look for fights when this happens, minions hurt.",

Once his E is down or you stun him during its wind up time, he can't escape so it should be an easy kill. If he starts the fight off by using his E, then he's essentially inviting his own death. Either Q dance or dodge with E, and he won't be able to escape. This sets up for an easy all-in using the combo above.",

DON’T FIRE WINDSLASH unless you can bait his flash or if you combo it with your W (while his orange is on CD).

You can either bait it when you Q to him after he has silenced you and then you should look for a re-engage before his W comes up or just straight up follow him.
